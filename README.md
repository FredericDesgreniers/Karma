# Karma
This is a remake of an old bot I made. It basically crawls certain websites (primarily youtube) for new content and posts it on reddit as well as informs the client of the content. 

It is seperated in two parts:
<ul>
<li><h2>Server</h2>
Designed to run on a vps / dedicated server, requires having Java 8 installed a mysql database running.
<br>
Finds content on the web and can post content automatically, send desktop notifications and sms notifications when an action is or can be taken (post, remove, add spoiler tag)
</li>

<li><h2>Client</h2>
Designed to run on a personal computer with a screen. Requires Java 8.
<br>
Has a list of recent content, allows posting it on reddit and is used to display notifications on a desktop. Also has a in-app web browser to view the content. 
</li>
</ul>
